Writing skills are an important part of communication.  Good writing skills allow you to communicate your
message with clarity and ease to a far larger audience than through face-to-face or telephone 
conversations.
You might be called upon to write a report, plan or strategy at work; write a grant application or press
release within a volunteering role; or you may fancy communicating your ideas online via a blog.
And, of course, a well written CV or résumé with no spelling or grammatical mistakes is 
essential if you want a new job.
Today, when anyone can be their own publisher, we see more and more examples of poor writing skills both
in print and on the web.  Poor writing skills create poor first impressions and many readers will have an
immediate negative reaction if they spot a spelling or grammatical mistake. As just one example, a spelling mistake on a commercial web page may cause potential customers to doubt the 
credibility of the website and the organisation.
